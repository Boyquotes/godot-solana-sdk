# Security Policy


Security is crucial for godot-solana-sdk. Security flaws can impact end users in many ways including losing crypto assets. In such an early stage as the godot-solana-sdk is currently in, it is not recommended to use any wallet with mainnet assets. Remember that keypairs used by the plugin could be compromised through vulnerabilities in godot itself or in the GDExtension.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have found a security vulnerability you can report it as a regular issue [here](https://github.com/Virus-Axel/godot-solana-sdk/issues/new/choose) but please be careful! If you think someone can actually exploit the flaw you might want to report it secretly [here](https://github.com/Virus-Axel/godot-solana-sdk/security/advisories/new). The vulnerability will be prioritized if end users' crypto is at stake.
