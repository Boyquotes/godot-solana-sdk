# How to use
Download the binaries in the release section [here](https://github.com/Virus-Axel/godot-solana-sdk/releases). place the binaries anywhere in your godot project directory under res://bin/. Reload your project and you are good to go. Warning! This readme is a little outdated. See examples for an up to date usage example.

# Nodes
There is currently only one node provided by this plugin, that is the Transaction node.
## Transaction
This node is a customizable transaction that can be signed and serialized. The transaction consists of:
- A payer Pubkey.
- An array of instructions.
- An array of signing keypairs.

The transaction can be signed and serialized for use with phantom and the Solana RPC API.

# Resources

## Instruction
The instruction resource consists of:
- Program ID
- Data
- List of account metas

The data is sent as it is and no serialization/deserialization is supported. The list of account metas are passed to the program specified by the program ID. The instruction tells the solana program what to do.

## AccountMeta
The AccountMeta consists of an account key (A pubkey or a keypair) and information on weather the account is signer and if it is a writeable account.

## Pubkey
The pubkey is used for many things. It can be created from seeds, from associated tokens and by setting the base58 value or bytes yourself.

## Keypair
A keypair has a private key and a public key. They are used to sign transactions.

## Hash
A simpler version of pubkey. Used to pass blockhashes when signing transactions.

# Work in Progress
I will continue to work on this plugin. Feel free to open issues or feature requests.

# Setting up Build Environment
The plugin builds easily for your host platform with [SCons](https://www.scons.org/).

```
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:Virus-Axel/godot-solana-sdk.git
cd godot-solana-sdk
scons
```

This repository also includes means to build all the binaries in containers. This requires [Podman](https://podman.io/) to be installed.

```
scons --container_build
```
